	# configure.in: Fix compiler flags selection to be correct for
	both FreeBSD 4.x (aka -STABLE) and FreeBSD 5.x (aka -CURRENT).
	
2004-07-01  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* include/install-sh doc/install-sh: New files.

Thu Jun 24 15:39:00 CEST 2004 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* alloc.c: use Hans' fix for bug #59557.

2004-06-18  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* darwin_stop_world.c: Make the world actually stop.  This seems
	to fix the finalizer thread signalling deadlock in 58706.

Sat Jun 5 19:38:20 CEST 2004 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* alloc.c: temporary fix for bug #59557.

Tue May 25 13:41:08 EDT 2004 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* darwin_stop_world.c: more thread died races fixes.

2004-05-21  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* pthread_stop_world.c: Merged the changes from linux_threads.c.

	* linux_threads.c: Removed, this file no longer exists in the
	latest upstream version.

2004-05-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* libgc.patch: Removed.  There's no need to have this in a
	separate file, just use CVS.

2004-05-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove tests from EXTRA_DIST.
	
Wed May 19 18:57:30 CEST 2004 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* darwin_stop_world.c: deal with threads that die before they can be
	suspended (should solce the thread_info failed aborts).

Wed May 19 18:42:23 CEST 2004 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: update correctly from the libgc sources:
	this excludes linux_threads.c from the build: Martin will have to port
	his changes to the new code, since linux_threads.c doesn't exist
	anymore in the upstream sources.

2004-05-19  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* configure.in ($enable_embed_check): New internal option that
	will be passed by mono's configure.
	(THREADS): Use $with_libgc_threads, which is passed by mono's
	configure.

2004-05-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	Importing Boehm GC 6.3 alpha 6.

2004-03-24 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* gcj_mlc.c: Do finalization.

	This is a patch from Hans Boehm that fixes a bug where
	GC_gcj_malloc never does finalization.

	See:
	http://www.hpl.hp.com/hosted/linux/mail-archives/gc/2004-March/000359.html
	http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55644

	Fixes #55644.

	I am checking this in at Zoltan's request.

2003-11-07  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* autogen.sh: Fix previous patch and silence noisy GNU which.	
	
	* autogen.sh: Applied patch from Peter Teichman (peter@ximian.com). 
	Use 'glibtool' instead of 'libtool' on OSX. 

2003-10-01  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <yoro@wanadoo.es>

	* Makefile.am: Change lib_LTLIBRARIES to noinst_LTLIBRARIES because
	of libmonogc is included inside libmono and without this change it
	breaks down and not include it.

2003-09-26  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* mips_sgi_mach_dep.S: Remove since it is a duplicate of .s and it
	breaks cvs checkout under windows.

Wed Sep 17 17:29:11 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: disable ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS: managed pointers
	are not allowed in the heap, so this should be safe and it helps
	reducing false positives.

2003-08-28  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* pthread_support.c:
	* aix_irix_threads.c:  Applied bug fix from alpha libgc

2003-08-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	Imported Boehm GC 6.2.

2003-06-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* include/gc.h: Fixed compiler warnings.

2003-06-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* include/libgc-mono-debugger.h: New header file.  This is
	installed as <mono/private/libgc-mono-debugger.h>, but it's a
	private header files and may only be used by the Mono Debugger.

	* Makefile.am: Build libmonogc.la and install it.  For some
	reason, using a libtool convenience archive doesn't work here.

2003-06-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* libgc-mono.pc.in: Removed.

	* Makefile.am: Don't install anything.

	* configure.in: We're now embedded in mono and can't be built as a
	stand-alone module any longer.

2003-05-17  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* libgc.patch, libgc.log: Added patch against the original version
	and a ChangeLog entry.

2003-05-17  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* misc.c, os_dep.c, include/private/gc_priv.h: Back to the
	original version.

	* linux_threads.c: Use the `gc_thread_vtable' internally in this
	file instead of calling it from the header files.

2003-05-16  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* include/gc.h (GCThreadFunctions): Removed the `pthread_*'
	function since we don't need them here.

	* include/gc_pthread_redirects.h: Put back the original version.

2003-04-08  Alp Toker <alp@atoker.com>

	* configure.in: fix automake 1.6 compatibility without breaking
	previous versions (AM_PROG_AS)

2003-03-31  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* include/gc.h (GCThreadFunctions): New type.
	(gc_thread_vtable): New global variable.

	* include/gc_pthread_redirects.h: Use the `gc_thread_vtable'
	vtable for the redirects instead of calling the methods directly.
	This allows us to override them at runtime.	

2003-03-31  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* include/Makefile.am: Install gc_pthread_redirects.h.

	* include/gc.h: `#include <gc/gc_pthread_redirects.h>', not
	`#include "gc_pthread_redirects.h"'.

2003-03-31  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Call the package `libgc-mono'.

	* libgc-mono.pc.in: Added pkg-config files.

2003-03-31  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	This is a modified version of Boehm GC 6.1.
